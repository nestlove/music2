            Christopher Brent Wood, better known by his stage name Brent Faiyaz, is an American singer from Columbia, Maryland. Faiyaz started making music at the age of 13. His parents were not always understanding of his dreams as a musician,
             which Faiyaz said was warranted as he was "always distracted" by his love for music. Faiyaz began uploading his experimental music (Black Child EP) onto SoundCloud in 2014 and moved from his hometown Columbia, Maryland to Charlotte, North Carolina before settling in Los Angeles,
              California to further his music career.

                On January 19, 2015, he released his debut single "Allure". On June 1, 2016, Faiyaz released "Invite Me", the lead single from his upcoming debut EP.On September 19, 2016, his 21st birthday, the EP entitled A.M. Paradox was released and 
                received positive reviews from music critics.

                In October 2016, Faiyaz formed a group named Sonder with record producers Dpat and Atu.
                The group released their debut single, "One night only," on October 25. On December 16, 2016, Faiyaz was featured alongside rapper Shy Glizzy on the single "Crew" by rapper GoldLink.

            Made up of producers Atu and Dpat with lead vocals by Baltimore-based singer Brent Faiyaz, the collaborative entity Sonder started out making songs characterized by a fragmented, futuristic take on traditional R&B, but softened their approach as their music reached a wider audience. 
            Their early singles led to 2017's retro-fitted Into EP.

A.M. Paradox
Sonder was formed in 2016 and started their run in a flurry of productivity. 
In the fall of 2016, the group dropped singles "Victoria," "Undone," and "Sheath" in quick succession, all three songs notable in their seductive,
 low-lit production and extended running times -- none were under ten-minutes long. Gaining momentum and buzz from this initial blast of particularly uniform tracks, Sonder followed up in the early months of 2017 with the seven-song EP Into, 
 dialing back the track times and switching styles somewhat from the smokescreen haze of their early output, and instead opting for a more direct sound that nodded to the production of '90s R&B innovators like Timbaland and Ginuwine. During this time, Faiyaz was also active releasing songs solo under the A.M. Paradox moniker.
  Early 2018 saw the trio issue the smoky single "One Night Only," and the next year the group released the warped and atmospheric new song "What You Heard." As the years went on, all of the group's tracks were eventually streamed millions of times. In 2021 Sonder released the new song "Nobody but You," featuring a hook with vocals from England's Jorja Smith.
